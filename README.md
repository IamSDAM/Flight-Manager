# Flight-Manager
This Flight Management System was developed as part of my college C++ programming course in collaboration with my teammate Jason.  
The application allows airline staff and passengers to manage flights, passenger records, and employee operations through a clean, menu-driven interface.  
The goal was to practice object-oriented programming, dynamic memory management, and working with STL containers, while building a modular system that can be extended with new features.  
Through this project, I gained experience in code organization, teamwork, and version control workflows â€” skills I continue to apply in my software development journey.
